Now since it is on the list do I file as a new claim or ask for a DRO review? Thanks Gents. My father in-law just got service connected for agent orange, but I don't see hypothyroidism on the list?  I'm looking at this list.  *Edited by EKco22 to remove law firm website*  \n",

I think it’s what triggered my hypothyroidism and my autoimmune disease!  You could go on Google  , and start with Chernobyl radiation poisoning cloud over Germany and start your search the Chernobyl Affects ,Chernobyl  areas affected by radiation ,and Military vehicles and aircraft exhaust exposure, Chernobyl  acciddent and its consequences, public health (fuels petroleum, oil,lubricant how the Chernobyl  cloud  affected cognitive abilities in Germany, a map of how far was your company from Chernobyl, a map of the border and your company ,Google the distance of the town to Chernobyl how many miles, Chernobyl  Hypothyroidism , Chernobyl Autoimmune disease, Chernobyl radiation zone area the was affected  , ▪︎▪︎the Chernobyl accident - an epidemiological perspective this the part the talks about THYRIOD CANCER FORM CHERNOBYL. and watch also YouTube on Chernobyl radiation. then re- file your claim and submit again. Do give up all on this website will give you a feed back .remember  Chernobyl radius zone over Germany and chernobyl dates also all are important.  \n",
