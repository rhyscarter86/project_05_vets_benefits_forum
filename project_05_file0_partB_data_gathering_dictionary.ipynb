       " 'p1511097': {'post_content': 'Hello everyone:\\n\\nI am looking for what I should do for next steps. When I received my rating, the VA offered life insurance, providing I applied, which I did. I faxed it in per the instructions on the letter. I had not heard back for well over a month, called, and the VA Rep said that they no longer accept faxes, and that at the first of the year, the fax was shut down. I was stunned to say the least. I stated I had a transmissioin confirmation and a phone record to prove the transmission went through. The VA rep stated there was 0 record of if, and that it was never received by the VA. The rep then stated I probably sent it to the wrong fax machine. I was not happy with that comment.\\n\\nI provided the number on the letter, and gave the date and time of the VA employee that told me to fax in the paperwork, which the VA rep then said it did not matter. The VA has not received anything. I then asked about ID theft, as if the fax number was terminated, but still accepting faxes, what happens to our personal information? The VA rep said I should talk to a supervisor. I requested that, and the VA rep stated they would call back in 72 hours (3 business days). They never did. \\n\\nWhat are my options now? \\n\\nI can attempt to mail the paperwork to the PA office, which would have be done securely via Priority or Registered mail, as I am not computer savvy enough to do it online. \\n\\nMore importantly, where did the paperwork go? It concerns me that I followed VA instructions and now the VA does not have the information, all ready for ID theft. \\n\\nAny ideas?\\n\\nThanks all.',\n",

The vast majority of FDC claims still require additional development.  \\n\\nLike I just mentioned in another post, it really doesn’t matter any more from a claim processing time whether a Veteran files an FDC claim or not.  FDC claims used to be given priority, plus at one time there was a financial incentive tied to original FDC claims. But since the NWQ started several years ago, I have not witnessed any priority applied to FDC claims.',\n",

We did the original claim on March 30, 2020 in which we sent the basic information to start the case. Then in May they sent me a letter stating that the information we sent didn't meet the minimum level of detail needed for the VA to seek assistance from the U.S. Army and Joint service records research center. So we sent them deck logs from my ship with dates and times of the incidents that happened while I was aboard along with the names of the poor sailors that were not as lucky as I was.\\n\\nIf you can call that luck, for over 50 years I have lived with this curse and for 45 or those years I never even realized what the hell was wrong with me.

I never was able to keep a job, been married\\xa0 three times and at this stage in my life living on $850.00 SS check.\\n\\nThen in June they sent another letter stating that my VA medical center nearest to me would schedule me for an exam in connection with my claim. Along with that they said they were requesting my service treatment records from the service department. They said if I had them I could submit a copy to them which I did.\\n\\nThe letter also stated that they had requested my entire service personnel file. After that I get a letter every now and again that they are still working on it saying how sorry they are it's taking so long.

My record shows that I repeatedly tested positive for Hawkins and Neers (impingement tests). After eleven months of treatment with steroid shots and physical therapy (all documented in my service treatment records), the orthopedic specialist diagnosed me with: \"bilateral capsulorrhaphy arthritis and shoulder impingement”. He also stated that he recommended acromioplasty to remove the bone spurs and \"clean up\" the shoulders.\\n\\nGiven that arthritis is recognized as a chronic condition by the VA and my record shows decreased range of motion and strength, I don\\'t know how they could have denied my claim in good faith.

       " 'p1510050': {'post_content': \"Hello,\\n\\nFirst post here. Looking for some guidance on how I should go about my migraines claim. I was prior active duty and currently a reservist for the last 12 years. I have 2 active duty gulf-war area deployments in 2012 and 2015 with a lot of time spent on the flight line conducting ERO's (Engine Running On/off loads) behind C-130's and C-17's. The burning jet-fuel is very toxic and nauseating when doing these because you are basically sitting in MHE behind a running jet while you load or off load cargo. I am currently service connected for tinnitus. I have had intermittent migraines after the last deployment that are sometimes triggered by the tinnitus, but nothing was noted in my records while deployed because this started happening after the deployments.\\n\\nOver the last year, I started a log and have been tracking the migraines which are about 3-4 times per month. I have been treated by my civilian physician and been prescribed meds for my migraine condition. I have taken many days of off work because when I have them, I am basically bed ridden until it is gone. This has caused me to obtain FMLA from my civilian employer so I can take time off when needed.\\n\\nI was on a recent 2-week annual tour while on active duty for training orders with the reserves (which I have a copy of) and had a bad migraine which I went to the local emergency room for (this is SOP, our base does not have a medical facility). I have documentation showing I was treated at a hospital while on active duty orders.\\n\\nMy question is, how should I go about filing a claim for this? I have heard filing migraines secondary to tinnitus is possible, but it appears that many of these claims are denied due to a lack of medical literature connecting them to each other. My other thought is that I could have try to have the migraines service connected as presumptive as a gulf war veteran. My last thought was to use my ER visit while on active duty orders for a direct service connection.\\n\\nI appreciate any advise or additional information on what my best course of action would be to pursue this claim.\\n\\nThanks in advance.\",\n",

I have already brought up the conversation to my Dr. about the tinnitus being the trigger. He pretty much dismissed the tinnitus as there is not anything he can do for it. I have been adamant that the tinnitus is a contributor. His documented response (in my work sick notes and FMLA paperwork) is that the tinnitus is subjective, so I am not sure that is going to help me much and don't think he will write any type of nexus for it, this is why I was looking for another approach.\\n\\nI am actually more curious about the direct service connection based on my gulf war deployments and ER visit during annual tour, but being that the tinnitus does contribute to the aggravation, I just don't know the best way to file it.\\n\\nThanks for any suggestions!\",\n",

Please find a good VSO and get a good review of the records. A good VSO was a great help to me and over the period from retirement in 1979 until 2006 my disability rate went from 30% to 100%.

I left Vietnam in 1972 and retired in 1979. I believe that it was about 1985 when I was rated for the neuropathy. It was partly from evidence of neuropathy in my records and the onset of diabetes. I had complained of a tingling in my feet and lower legs and a numb feeling in them. This was while still in the military. Thankfully the doctor took good notes. \\n\\nSent from my SM-G960U using Tapatalk\\n\\n',\n",

My father and I put the roof on that in 1963.\\xa0 That is a story in itself. As this picture shows, the roof was cedar shakes. Now I believe it is covered with metal.\\xa0\\n\\n',\n",

According to Tapatalk support, most things are proofed on the Free version before being added to the Pro version. I have both, but there are some inconsistencies, all of which I’m not aware. In the pro version, you can award “Kin,” but they’re not “Gold” points. On the free version you can “Gift” but I’m not sure how the gift equates to Gold? I contribute to both Tapatalk & VBN, but the relationship, at least to me, is confusing. \\n\\nI’ve not fully done a deep dive on all three, but regarding “checking in” and “voting” we should be able to easily clean some clocks re: Blog Placement.

I have used them over the years around three times twice for flat tires and the last for a break down this past April on I-20 in MS. I had good experiences in the past with them however this last one was a nightmare. We were headed back to PA from our winter Texas stay when I felt a vibration in the steering wheel that got worse than saw smoke coming out from under the hood. Stopped quick was on the road side but the back of the 5th was just barely off the interstate truck quite would not start. I jumped out opened the hood oil everywhere ok this is not good. So at 9am we called Good Sam Road service ok we will locate someone and call you back. After an hour in the sun no call so I called them back. We are still trying to locate someone that can tow you we will get back to you. After another hour called again same story. Long story short called more times around 4PM they sent a wrecker he said he could not tow us we were to long. So called Good Sam back about 5 PM they called and said they located someone. So the towing service called and said they would be there in about 30 minutes. So thirty minutes go by I called the towing service back he said oh Good Sam called us and canceled said we wanted to much money. So now we have been sitting in a dangerous spot for over 8 hours. I said to te towing guy can you come get us if I pay you, he said he told Good Sam at 10AM they could come tow us but they never called him back. So he came towed us to the auto repair place that said they could look at our truck right away. The ford dealer said they could not look at it for 3 weeks.\\xa0 So paid the towing guy $600.00. The College Park Auto and Quick Lube place works on allot of diesel trucks they were so nice to us. One guy that works there tows is 5th he towed our camper to an RV park the next day they let us stay on their lot over night. He even loaned us his car. Anyway had a broken piston is a 2005 Power Stroke F350 HD but only had 84,000 miles. Long story short they gave me 3 options I went with a complete rebuilt new engine rebuilt by Ford with a two year warranty at any for dealer. I did call Good Sam had a few choice words with them they did reimburse me my $600.00 but I am so mad at them letting us sit there for over 8 hours when they could have had us towed at 10AM. Not sure if I will renew my services with them will check and see what AAA wants. Depending on how much AAA wants I may stick with Good Sam is AAA it to much. Good Sam does cover everything even my boat trailer for a flat tire. Happy RVing\\xa0',\n",

Discounts on campgrounds off the web I never did.  But always ask for Good Sam, AARP, AAA and Veteran discounts or the rv park's promotions.  Peace\",\n",

My guess is you submitted a 526EZ listing all the conditions you mentioned.   This would result in the knees and tinnitus being removed from the claim and a letter sent to you explaining why. If you have new and relevant evidence, you should have submitted a claim for your knees and tinnitus on a 0995.

Survivir but I still believe in KISS and as I understand it, the only numbers that mattter when it comes to actually calculating the COLA are the numbers for July, August, and September. Those numbers of this year\\xa0 averaged out will be compared to the numbers of last year for July, August, and September\\xa0 averaged out, and the % increase, or % decrease, or % no change, will determine our COLA increase (or lack thereof).\\n\\nIt seems like all these other months of data is just showing the trend but cannot be used for actual forecasting purposes. Things can and have changed radically in those last three months of the gov\\'t fiscal year.',\n",

I know it is the average of three months but look look at past averages--only if the CPI changes courses will this be not true.\\xa0 So, as of the Apr CPI (227.012) we are already about 8 1/2 months into the 12 year period with about 3 1/2 months to go (until about mid Aug).\\xa0 If the economy continues at about the same rate in the remaining periods as it has over the previous months, and using Survivir's CPI numbers, we sould see something like: \\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 -\\xa0 From last year's benchmark through Apr '12 there has been a 1.7% growth.\\xa0 [(227.012/223.233) -1] x 100 = 1.7\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 -\\xa0 If it grew 1.7% in 8.5 months it should grow about another 0.7% over the next 3.5 months, hence the 12th month growth should be about 2.4%.\\n\\nWould I bet the farm on these numbers?

More than a couple, doubt it based on the last 10 years? I live less than 70 miles inland and hurricanes/tropical storms are a way of life around here from late July thru end of Sept. We actually count on it for our mid to late summer rain. \\n\\nIn the past 8 years or so, it hasn\\'t happened. Who knows, maybe this year will be an active hurrican season or another minor year. In any event, it is highly doubtful that a major hurrican or major tornado will make a hill of beans\\' difference in the overall economy.\\xa0 \\n\\nIt is also highly doubtful that any appreciable amount of jobs will be created between now and Oct 1 such that any affect will be seen on inflation for that reason. Even if so, people do not start spending immediately after they get a job and right now, as of today\\'s report, jobs are shrinking, not adding.\\xa0\\n\\nIt is possible that gas may spark back up, since the situations in Iran, the ME, and N. Korea remain volatile. Other than that, there is nothing looming on the \\'\\'summer horizon\\'\\' that may/will potentially wreak havoc on inflation. Hurricanes and tornadoes, although very painful and expensive locally to their impact, have virtually no measureable affect on overall inflation in a $ 15,000,000,000,000 Economy. \\n\\nI do not look for much this year in a COLA but, will gladly accept whatever it is. If it\\'s 1.7% or so, then that\\'s better than the \\'\\'zero\\'s\" of the past.',\n",

KISS and as I understand it, the only numbers that mattter when it comes to actually calculating the COLA are the numbers for July, August, and September. Those numbers of this year\\xa0 averaged out will be compared to the numbers of last year for July, August, and September\\xa0 averaged out, and the % increase, or % decrease, or % no change, will determine our COLA increase (or lack thereof).\\n\\nIt seems like all these other months of data is just showing the trend but cannot be used for actual forecasting purposes. Things can and have changed radically in those last three months of the gov\\'t fiscal year.\\n\\n\\n\\nHerdgrunt:\\n\\nI just wanted YOU to be the FIRST one to know.\\n\\n\\nThat the \"Potential\" 2013 COLA will be going UP...Next Week...when the CPI-W Index for May is Released.\\n\\n\\nThe Current CPI-W Index is at 227.012 for the Month of April.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t bore YOU with the details...KISS ya Knows...\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBut, even IF the Month of May would be THE SAME as April(227.012)\\n\\n\\nThat would STILL INCREASE the\\xa0\"Potential\" 2013 COLA\\xa0to about 1.6%.\\n\\n\\nThe Current\\xa0\"Potential\" 2013 COLA\\xa0Increase is at about 1.2%.\\n\\n\\nFor the\\xa0\"Potential\" 2013 COLA Increase of 1.2% to remain UN-CHANGED.\\n\\n\\nThe CPI-W Index for May would HAVE TO DROP DOWN to about 224.317.\\n\\n\\nThat would be a DROP in the CPI-W Index of about\\xa02.695...from its Current 217.012.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll BET...that will NOT Happen.\\n\\n\\nSurvivir',\n",

As Survivir says the numbers move up and down, sometimes rather erratically.\\n \\n For instance, there are forecasts that meat prices will drop in the short-term because farmers and ranchers will be forced to sell off herds early as a result of the drought. The effect will lower the foodbasket prices for now and then these same prices will shoot up when the surplus of meat products has moved through the market. And the volatility of the energy market limits the ability to forecast, with any reliability, what energy will cost.\\n \\n I see the monthly discussion as something for some to do and discuss. I suppose if it provides something to keep folks occupied it is fine.\\n \\n If the increase in the CPI-W is at least one-tenth of one percent (0.1 percent), there will be a COLA. However, if the CPI-W increases by less than 0.05 percent, or if the CPI-W decreases, there will not be a COLA. That is what the current law provides for.\",\n",

Also, because of the drought, ranchers have been flooding the market with beef cattle, so we currently have an oversupply there.

There was no attempt to read the crystal ball and come up with some profound statement of \"What we might receive, are less likely to receive, are more likely to receive, are not going to receive.\" That fine gentleman stopped posting and now we have pages of rambling jibberish and chart after table to tell us there is no real way of predicting what will happen. For instance, what will the CPI-W do if Iran blows up a couple of oil terminals in the Persian Gulf? Or a major refinery blows up in Venezuela? Or a pipeline shuts down in Canada? No one can say but it seems that\\xa0some here enjoy the\\xa0mental masturbation involved in trying to predict it.\\n\\nIn my most humble opinion all of the monthly yapping is a complete waste of time. I know some here will jump up to defend\\xa0it. I really don\\'t care.

Relying on Someone Else\\'s Say-So.\\n\\n\\nIf YOU show Me and Others...how YOU come to the conclusion of the 1.1%.\\n\\n\\nThen I would be able to either point out where YOU are Incorrect...or I \"WOULD ADMIT\" that I am Wrong.\\n\\n\\nBut, YOU, like so many Other Naysayers, keep saying that I am Wrong.\\n\\n\\nWITHOUT Any Proof \"FROM YOU\"...where I am Wrong.\\n\\n\\nShow ME...Your Step-By-Step way of coming to the 1.1% Result!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoing to Your\\xa0http://www.moaa.org/colawatch/\\xa0 link.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThey Clearly State the Following: \"The May CPI of 229.399 is 1.1% above the FY2013 COLA baseline of 226.936.\"\\n\\n\\nWhen Last Year\\'s AVERAGE of (226.936) is Subtracted from the ONE MONTH of May(229.399)\\n\\n\\nAnd then Divided by Last Year\\'s AVERAGE...the Result is 1.085%...which Rounds-Off to 1.1%.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is the WRONG!

The last base quarter is the third quarter of 2012, the last year in which a COLA became effective. The average CPI-W for this quarter is 226.936.

It now stands 1.9 percent above the FY2014 COLA baseline of 230.327.\\n\\n Next update comes out on Aug 19th, and there are 3 months left to determine next year's adjustment.Actually, that is NOT True. The COLA is actually at 1.6468%...for the 2015 COLA...which Rounds DOWN to 1.6%.\\n\\nWhoever does the MOAA Calculations is NOT Correct...they are WRONG!\\n\\n\\nThey are using a ONE(1)Month CPI-W Index to Compare it to the THREE(3)Month AVERAGE of the Baseline(230.327).\\n\\n\\nYou can NOT do that!!\\n\\n\\nThe Current Baseline was acquired by using the AVERAGE of the 2013 CPI-W Index Numbers from the Months of July + August + September..\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhich were 230.084(J) + 230.359(A) + 230.537(S) for a Total of 690.980.\\n\\n\\nThen the 690.980 is Divided by (3) to get the AVERAGE of those Three Months...to compare it to the AVERAGE of the Previous Year's Baseline.\\n\\n\\nWhich was also compiled by using the Three Months of July, August and September of 2012.(The Previous 3-Month Baseline was 226.936).\\n\\n\\nThe 2012 (3-Month Baseline) was compared to the 2013 (3-Month Baseline)...which resulted in a 1.5% COLA Increase.\\n\\n\\nThere must be an EQUAL Comparison. You can NOT Compare ONE Month to an AVERAGE of THREE Months...as MOAA did.\\n\\n\\nI will try explaining this...again...using Two Charts.\\n\\n\\nChart # 1 shows Each Month from July 2013 through the current release of June 2014...and its CPI-W Index Number for that Month.\\n\\n\\nThe Total for the CPI-W Index Months of July, August and September are shown...(690.980).\\n\\n\\nThe AVERAGE(230.327) of those THREE MONTHS...are what makes up the BASELINE Number.\\n\\n\\nThat BASELINE number will be used to compare the 2014 BASELINE number to the 2013 BASELINE number to get the 2015 COLA Increase.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn Chart # 2 I have used the THREE MONTHS to compare to the BASELINE Number.\\n\\n\\nI think everyone could agree that July, August and September of 2013 was AVERAGED to get the BASELINE.\\n\\n\\nThe CPI-W Index Number for September was Released in October...To compare its BASELINE to the Previous Year's BASELINE.\\n\\n\\nThen, in November the CPI-W Index for October was Released.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOctober was the added to August and September to get a THREE MONTH TOTAL.\\n\\n\\nFrom which an AVERAGE is acquired. That is what is displayed as A-S-O in Chart # 2.\\n\\n\\nThen in November, when October's CPI-W Index was Released. That is what is displayed as S-O-N in Chart # 2.\\n\\n\\nAnd so on...so that Each Month...THREE Months are Compared to THREE Months.\\n\\n\\nThe RED Numbers represent those Months where the COLA was a NEGATIVE.\\n\\n\\nThe GREEN\\xa0Numbers represent those Months where the COLA was a POSITIVE.\\n\\n\\nJust look at the TOTALS of the THREE Numbers.\\n\\n\\nThe Total for the BASELINE is 690.980.\\n\\n\\nFor the First FIVE(5)Months...the Totals were BELOW 690.980.\\nThe Totals for A-S-O was 690.631.\\nThe Totals for S-O-N was 689.405\\nThe Totals for O-N-D was 688.042\\nThe Totals for N-D-J was 688.347\\nThe Totals for D-J-F was 690.085\\nIt wasn't until J-F-M(January-February-March)\\xa0that the Totals went back up OVER the BASELINE of 690.980 to 693.471.\\n\\n\\nAs I said...just look at the TOTALS for the THREE Numbers..and compare the TOTALS for THREE Numbers with the BASELINE Number.\\n\\n\\nAnd it will give you the MOST ACCURATE Number...because it is based on a Comparison of Current THREE Number TOTAL.\\n\\n\\nTo the THREE Number TOTAL of the BASELINE.\\n\\n\\nI think all of this will be CLEARER...when the THREE Numbers for J-A-S 2014 are revealed...and hopefully I will be vindicated.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHere are those Charts.\\n\\n\\nCHART # 1  EACH MONTH   CPI-W INDEX   TOTAL   AVERAGE     JUL(2013)   230.084           AUG(2013)   230.359   690.980   230.327     SEP(2013)   230.537           OCT(2013)   229.735           NOV(2013)   229.133           DEC(2013)   229.174           JAN(2014)   230.040           FEB(2014)   230.871           MAR(2014)   232.560           APR(2014)   233.443           MAY(2014)   234.216           JUN(2014)   234.702           JUL(2014)              AUG(2014)              SEP(2014)                            *********************************************************************************  *********************************************************************************                CHART # 2  3-MONTHS   TOTAL   AVERAGE   COLA   ROUNDED  J-A-S   690.980   230.327   Baseline   0.0%  A-S-O   690.631   230.210   -0.05079%   -0.1%  S-O-N   689.405   229.802   0.22793%   0.2%  O-N-D   688.042   229.347   0.42548%   0.4%  N-D-J   688.347   229.449   0.38119%   0.4%  D-J-F   690.085   230.028   0.12981%   0.1%  J-F-M   693.471   231.157   0.36035%   0.4%  F-M-A   696.894   232.291   0.85270%   0.9%  M-A-M   700.219   233.406   1.33680%   1.3%  A-M-J   702.361   234.120   1.64680%   1.6%  M-J-J              J-J-A              J-A-S              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSurvivir\",\n",

This is because they are NOT predicting or projecting what the COLA will be. \\xa0Rather they are showing how far the current month CPI is above or below the COLA baseline (the number we need to be above to get a COLA). \\xa0So every year the line starts in January at the baseline. \\xa00% on their chart IS the baseline number. \\xa0What they are reporting is that the August number was 1.6% above the baseline. \\xa0That is all they are telling you. \\xa0In effect, if you wanted to run a projection spreadsheet like Survivr does, you would take the number they reported for June, July and August and average them...so the 1.6% number is ONE of the three numbers you use as an input.\\n\\n\\nOn their page now they also say \"MOAA predicts the 2015 COLA to fall somewhere between 1.6 and 1.8 percent.\" which is right in line with what Survivr is saying and what my \"basic math by looking at\\xa0the chart came up with\"...\\n\\n\\nHope this makes sense and thank you for your service from a lowly 26 year Navy guy...',\n",

The purpose of the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is to ensure that the purchasing power of Social Security and SSI benefits is not eroded by inflation.\\n\\n\\nFor purposes of determining the COLA, the average CPI-W for the third calendar quarter of the last year a COLA was determined is compared to the average CPI-W for the third calendar quarter of the current year. The resulting percentage increase, if any, represents the percentage that will be used to increase Social Security benefits beginning for December of the current year. SSI benefits increase by the same percentage the following month (January). If the increase in the CPI-W is at least one-tenth of one percent (0.1 percent), there will be a COLA. However, if the CPI-W increases by less than 0.05 percent, or if the CPI-W decreases, there will not be a COLA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSurvivir',\n",

I had not heard back for well over a month, called, and the VA Rep said that they no longer accept faxes, and that at the first of the year, the fax was shut down. I was stunned to say the least. I stated I had a transmissioin confirmation and a phone record to prove the transmission went through. The VA rep stated there was 0 record of if, and that it was never received by the VA. The rep then stated I probably sent it to the wrong fax machine. I was not happy with that comment.\\n\\nI provided the number on the letter, and gave the date and time of the VA employee that told me to fax in the paperwork, which the VA rep then said it did not matter. The VA has not received anything. I then asked about ID theft, as if the fax number was terminated, but still accepting faxes, what happens to our personal information? The VA rep said I should talk to a supervisor. I requested that, and the VA rep stated they would call back in 72 hours (3 business days). They never did. \\n\\nWhat are my options now? \\n\\nI can attempt to mail the paperwork to the PA office, which would have be done securely via Priority or Registered mail, as I am not computer savvy enough to do it online. \\n\\nMore importantly, where did the paperwork go? It concerns me that I followed VA instructions and now the VA does not have the information, all ready for ID theft. \\n\\nAny ideas?\\n\\nThanks all.',\n",

The vast majority of FDC claims still require additional development.  \\n\\nLike I just mentioned in another post, it really doesn’t matter any more from a claim processing time whether a Veteran files an FDC claim or not.

We did the original claim on March 30, 2020 in which we sent the basic information to start the case. Then in May they sent me a letter stating that the information we sent didn't meet the minimum level of detail needed for the VA to seek assistance from the U.S. Army and Joint service records research center. So we sent them deck logs from my ship with dates and times of the incidents that happened while I was aboard along with the names of the poor sailors that were not as lucky as I was.\\n\\nIf you can call that luck, for over 50 years I have lived with this curse and for 45 or those years I never even realized what the hell was wrong with me.

I never was able to keep a job, been married\\xa0 three times and at this stage in my life living on $850.00 SS check.\\n\\nThen in June they sent another letter stating that my VA medical center nearest to me would schedule me for an exam in connection with my claim. Along with that they said they were requesting my service treatment records from the service department. They said if I had them I could submit a copy to them which I did.\\n\\nThe letter also stated that they had requested my entire service personnel file. After that I get a letter every now and again that they are still working on it saying how sorry they are it's taking so long.

My record shows that I repeatedly tested positive for Hawkins and Neers (impingement tests). After eleven months of treatment with steroid shots and physical therapy (all documented in my service treatment records), the orthopedic specialist diagnosed me with: \"bilateral capsulorrhaphy arthritis and shoulder impingement”. He also stated that he recommended acromioplasty to remove the bone spurs and \"clean up\" the shoulders.\\n\\nGiven that arthritis is recognized as a chronic condition by the VA and my record shows decreased range of motion and strength, I don\\'t know how they could have denied my claim in good faith.

       " 'p1510050': {'post_content': \"Hello,\\n\\nFirst post here. Looking for some guidance on how I should go about my migraines claim. I was prior active duty and currently a reservist for the last 12 years. I have 2 active duty gulf-war area deployments in 2012 and 2015 with a lot of time spent on the flight line conducting ERO's (Engine Running On/off loads) behind C-130's and C-17's. The burning jet-fuel is very toxic and nauseating when doing these because you are basically sitting in MHE behind a running jet while you load or off load cargo. I am currently service connected for tinnitus. I have had intermittent migraines after the last deployment that are sometimes triggered by the tinnitus, but nothing was noted in my records while deployed because this started happening after the deployments.\\n\\nOver the last year, I started a log and have been tracking the migraines which are about 3-4 times per month. I have been treated by my civilian physician and been prescribed meds for my migraine condition. I have taken many days of off work because when I have them, I am basically bed ridden until it is gone. This has caused me to obtain FMLA from my civilian employer so I can take time off when needed.\\n\\nI was on a recent 2-week annual tour while on active duty for training orders with the reserves (which I have a copy of) and had a bad migraine which I went to the local emergency room for (this is SOP, our base does not have a medical facility). I have documentation showing I was treated at a hospital while on active duty orders.\\n\\nMy question is, how should I go about filing a claim for this? I have heard filing migraines secondary to tinnitus is possible, but it appears that many of these claims are denied due to a lack of medical literature connecting them to each other. My other thought is that I could have try to have the migraines service connected as presumptive as a gulf war veteran. My last thought was to use my ER visit while on active duty orders for a direct service connection.\\n\\nI appreciate any advise or additional information on what my best course of action would be to pursue this claim.\\n\\nThanks in advance.\",\n",

I have already brought up the conversation to my Dr. about the tinnitus being the trigger. He pretty much dismissed the tinnitus as there is not anything he can do for it. I have been adamant that the tinnitus is a contributor. His documented response (in my work sick notes and FMLA paperwork) is that the tinnitus is subjective, so I am not sure that is going to help me much and don't think he will write any type of nexus for it, this is why I was looking for another approach.\\n\\nI am actually more curious about the direct service connection based on my gulf war deployments and ER visit during annual tour, but being that the tinnitus does contribute to the aggravation, I just don't know the best way to file it.\\n\\nThanks for any suggestions!\",\n",

I left Vietnam in 1972 and retired in 1979. I believe that it was about 1985 when I was rated for the neuropathy. It was partly from evidence of neuropathy in my records and the onset of diabetes. I had complained of a tingling in my feet and lower legs and a numb feeling in them. This was while still in the military. Thankfully the doctor took good notes. \\n\\nSent from my SM-G960U using Tapatalk\\n\\n',\n",

According to Tapatalk support, most things are proofed on the Free version before being added to the Pro version. I have both, but there are some inconsistencies, all of which I’m not aware. In the pro version, you can award “Kin,” but they’re not “Gold” points. On the free version you can “Gift” but I’m not sure how the gift equates to Gold? I contribute to both Tapatalk & VBN, but the relationship, at least to me, is confusing. \\n\\nI’ve not fully done a deep dive on all three, but regarding “checking in” and “voting” we should be able to easily clean some clocks re: Blog Placement.

I have used them over the years around three times twice for flat tires and the last for a break down this past April on I-20 in MS. I had good experiences in the past with them however this last one was a nightmare. We were headed back to PA from our winter Texas stay when I felt a vibration in the steering wheel that got worse than saw smoke coming out from under the hood. Stopped quick was on the road side but the back of the 5th was just barely off the interstate truck quite would not start. I jumped out opened the hood oil everywhere ok this is not good. So at 9am we called Good Sam Road service ok we will locate someone and call you back. After an hour in the sun no call so I called them back. We are still trying to locate someone that can tow you we will get back to you. After another hour called again same story. Long story short called more times around 4PM they sent a wrecker he said he could not tow us we were to long. So called Good Sam back about 5 PM they called and said they located someone. So the towing service called and said they would be there in about 30 minutes. So thirty minutes go by I called the towing service back he said oh Good Sam called us and canceled said we wanted to much money. So now we have been sitting in a dangerous spot for over 8 hours. I said to te towing guy can you come get us if I pay you, he said he told Good Sam at 10AM they could come tow us but they never called him back. So he came towed us to the auto repair place that said they could look at our truck right away. The ford dealer said they could not look at it for 3 weeks.\\xa0 So paid the towing guy $600.00. The College Park Auto and Quick Lube place works on allot of diesel trucks they were so nice to us. One guy that works there tows is 5th he towed our camper to an RV park the next day they let us stay on their lot over night. He even loaned us his car. Anyway had a broken piston is a 2005 Power Stroke F350 HD but only had 84,000 miles. Long story short they gave me 3 options I went with a complete rebuilt new engine rebuilt by Ford with a two year warranty at any for dealer. I did call Good Sam had a few choice words with them they did reimburse me my $600.00 but I am so mad at them letting us sit there for over 8 hours when they could have had us towed at 10AM. Not sure if I will renew my services with them will check and see what AAA wants. Depending on how much AAA wants I may stick with Good Sam is AAA it to much. Good Sam does cover everything even my boat trailer for a flat tire. Happy RVing\\xa0',\n",

My guess is you submitted a 526EZ listing all the conditions you mentioned.   This would result in the knees and tinnitus being removed from the claim and a letter sent to you explaining why. If you have new and relevant evidence, you should have submitted a claim for your knees and tinnitus on a 0995.

Survivir but I still believe in KISS and as I understand it, the only numbers that mattter when it comes to actually calculating the COLA are the numbers for July, August, and September. Those numbers of this year\\xa0 averaged out will be compared to the numbers of last year for July, August, and September\\xa0 averaged out, and the % increase, or % decrease, or % no change, will determine our COLA increase (or lack thereof).\\n\\nIt seems like all these other months of data is just showing the trend but cannot be used for actual forecasting purposes. Things can and have changed radically in those last three months of the gov\\'t fiscal year.',\n",

I know it is the average of three months but look look at past averages--only if the CPI changes courses will this be not true.\\xa0 So, as of the Apr CPI (227.012) we are already about 8 1/2 months into the 12 year period with about 3 1/2 months to go (until about mid Aug).\\xa0 If the economy continues at about the same rate in the remaining periods as it has over the previous months, and using Survivir's CPI numbers, we sould see something like: \\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 -\\xa0 From last year's benchmark through Apr '12 there has been a 1.7% growth.\\xa0 [(227.012/223.233) -1] x 100 = 1.7\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 -\\xa0 If it grew 1.7% in 8.5 months it should grow about another 0.7% over the next 3.5 months, hence the 12th month growth should be about 2.4%.\\n\\nWould I bet the farm on these numbers?

More than a couple, doubt it based on the last 10 years? I live less than 70 miles inland and hurricanes/tropical storms are a way of life around here from late July thru end of Sept. We actually count on it for our mid to late summer rain. \\n\\nIn the past 8 years or so, it hasn\\'t happened. Who knows, maybe this year will be an active hurrican season or another minor year. In any event, it is highly doubtful that a major hurrican or major tornado will make a hill of beans\\' difference in the overall economy.\\xa0 \\n\\nIt is also highly doubtful that any appreciable amount of jobs will be created between now and Oct 1 such that any affect will be seen on inflation for that reason. Even if so, people do not start spending immediately after they get a job and right now, as of today\\'s report, jobs are shrinking, not adding.\\xa0\\n\\nIt is possible that gas may spark back up, since the situations in Iran, the ME, and N. Korea remain volatile. Other than that, there is nothing looming on the \\'\\'summer horizon\\'\\' that may/will potentially wreak havoc on inflation. Hurricanes and tornadoes, although very painful and expensive locally to their impact, have virtually no measureable affect on overall inflation in a $ 15,000,000,000,000 Economy. \\n\\nI do not look for much this year in a COLA but, will gladly accept whatever it is. If it\\'s 1.7% or so, then that\\'s better than the \\'\\'zero\\'s\" of the past.',\n",

KISS and as I understand it, the only numbers that mattter when it comes to actually calculating the COLA are the numbers for July, August, and September. Those numbers of this year\\xa0 averaged out will be compared to the numbers of last year for July, August, and September\\xa0 averaged out, and the % increase, or % decrease, or % no change, will determine our COLA increase (or lack thereof).\\n\\nIt seems like all these other months of data is just showing the trend but cannot be used for actual forecasting purposes. Things can and have changed radically in those last three months of the gov\\'t fiscal year.\\n\\n\\n\\nHerdgrunt:\\n\\nI just wanted YOU to be the FIRST one to know.\\n\\n\\nThat the \"Potential\" 2013 COLA will be going UP...Next Week...when the CPI-W Index for May is Released.\\n\\n\\nThe Current CPI-W Index is at 227.012 for the Month of April.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t bore YOU with the details...KISS ya Knows...\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBut, even IF the Month of May would be THE SAME as April(227.012)\\n\\n\\nThat would STILL INCREASE the\\xa0\"Potential\" 2013 COLA\\xa0to about 1.6%.\\n\\n\\nThe Current\\xa0\"Potential\" 2013 COLA\\xa0Increase is at about 1.2%.\\n\\n\\nFor the\\xa0\"Potential\" 2013 COLA Increase of 1.2% to remain UN-CHANGED.\\n\\n\\nThe CPI-W Index for May would HAVE TO DROP DOWN to about 224.317.\\n\\n\\nThat would be a DROP in the CPI-W Index of about\\xa02.695...from its Current 217.012.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll BET...that will NOT Happen.\\n\\n\\nSurvivir',\n",

As Survivir says the numbers move up and down, sometimes rather erratically.\\n \\n For instance, there are forecasts that meat prices will drop in the short-term because farmers and ranchers will be forced to sell off herds early as a result of the drought. The effect will lower the foodbasket prices for now and then these same prices will shoot up when the surplus of meat products has moved through the market. And the volatility of the energy market limits the ability to forecast, with any reliability, what energy will cost.\\n \\n I see the monthly discussion as something for some to do and discuss. I suppose if it provides something to keep folks occupied it is fine.\\n \\n If the increase in the CPI-W is at least one-tenth of one percent (0.1 percent), there will be a COLA. However, if the CPI-W increases by less than 0.05 percent, or if the CPI-W decreases, there will not be a COLA. That is what the current law provides for.\",\n",

Also, because of the drought, ranchers have been flooding the market with beef cattle, so we currently have an oversupply there.

There was no attempt to read the crystal ball and come up with some profound statement of \"What we might receive, are less likely to receive, are more likely to receive, are not going to receive.\" That fine gentleman stopped posting and now we have pages of rambling jibberish and chart after table to tell us there is no real way of predicting what will happen. For instance, what will the CPI-W do if Iran blows up a couple of oil terminals in the Persian Gulf? Or a major refinery blows up in Venezuela? Or a pipeline shuts down in Canada? No one can say but it seems that\\xa0some here enjoy the\\xa0mental masturbation involved in trying to predict it.\\n\\nIn my most humble opinion all of the monthly yapping is a complete waste of time. I know some here will jump up to defend\\xa0it. I really don\\'t care.

Relying on Someone Else\\'s Say-So.\\n\\n\\nIf YOU show Me and Others...how YOU come to the conclusion of the 1.1%.\\n\\n\\nThen I would be able to either point out where YOU are Incorrect...or I \"WOULD ADMIT\" that I am Wrong.\\n\\n\\nBut, YOU, like so many Other Naysayers, keep saying that I am Wrong.\\n\\n\\nWITHOUT Any Proof \"FROM YOU\"...where I am Wrong.\\n\\n\\nShow ME...Your Step-By-Step way of coming to the 1.1% Result!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoing to Your\\xa0http://www.moaa.org/colawatch/\\xa0 link.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThey Clearly State the Following: \"The May CPI of 229.399 is 1.1% above the FY2013 COLA baseline of 226.936.\"\\n\\n\\nWhen Last Year\\'s AVERAGE of (226.936) is Subtracted from the ONE MONTH of May(229.399)\\n\\n\\nAnd then Divided by Last Year\\'s AVERAGE...the Result is 1.085%...which Rounds-Off to 1.1%.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is the WRONG!

The last base quarter is the third quarter of 2012, the last year in which a COLA became effective. The average CPI-W for this quarter is 226.936.

It now stands 1.9 percent above the FY2014 COLA baseline of 230.327.\\n\\n Next update comes out on Aug 19th, and there are 3 months left to determine next year's adjustment.Actually, that is NOT True. The COLA is actually at 1.6468%...for the 2015 COLA...which Rounds DOWN to 1.6%.\\n\\nWhoever does the MOAA Calculations is NOT Correct...they are WRONG!\\n\\n\\nThey are using a ONE(1)Month CPI-W Index to Compare it to the THREE(3)Month AVERAGE of the Baseline(230.327).\\n\\n\\nYou can NOT do that!!\\n\\n\\nThe Current Baseline was acquired by using the AVERAGE of the 2013 CPI-W Index Numbers from the Months of July + August + September..\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhich were 230.084(J) + 230.359(A) + 230.537(S) for a Total of 690.980.\\n\\n\\nThen the 690.980 is Divided by (3) to get the AVERAGE of those Three Months...to compare it to the AVERAGE of the Previous Year's Baseline.\\n\\n\\nWhich was also compiled by using the Three Months of July, August and September of 2012.(The Previous 3-Month Baseline was 226.936).\\n\\n\\nThe 2012 (3-Month Baseline) was compared to the 2013 (3-Month Baseline)...which resulted in a 1.5% COLA Increase.\\n\\n\\nThere must be an EQUAL Comparison. You can NOT Compare ONE Month to an AVERAGE of THREE Months...as MOAA did.\\n\\n\\nI will try explaining this...again...using Two Charts.\\n\\n\\nChart # 1 shows Each Month from July 2013 through the current release of June 2014...and its CPI-W Index Number for that Month.\\n\\n\\nThe Total for the CPI-W Index Months of July, August and September are shown...(690.980).\\n\\n\\nThe AVERAGE(230.327) of those THREE MONTHS...are what makes up the BASELINE Number.\\n\\n\\nThat BASELINE number will be used to compare the 2014 BASELINE number to the 2013 BASELINE number to get the 2015 COLA Increase.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn Chart # 2 I have used the THREE MONTHS to compare to the BASELINE Number.\\n\\n\\nI think everyone could agree that July, August and September of 2013 was AVERAGED to get the BASELINE.\\n\\n\\nThe CPI-W Index Number for September was Released in October...To compare its BASELINE to the Previous Year's BASELINE.\\n\\n\\nThen, in November the CPI-W Index for October was Released.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOctober was the added to August and September to get a THREE MONTH TOTAL.\\n\\n\\nFrom which an AVERAGE is acquired. That is what is displayed as A-S-O in Chart # 2.\\n\\n\\nThen in November, when October's CPI-W Index was Released. That is what is displayed as S-O-N in Chart # 2.\\n\\n\\nAnd so on...so that Each Month...THREE Months are Compared to THREE Months.\\n\\n\\nThe RED Numbers represent those Months where the COLA was a NEGATIVE.\\n\\n\\nThe GREEN\\xa0Numbers represent those Months where the COLA was a POSITIVE.\\n\\n\\nJust look at the TOTALS of the THREE Numbers.\\n\\n\\nThe Total for the BASELINE is 690.980.\\n\\n\\nFor the First FIVE(5)Months...the Totals were BELOW 690.980.\\nThe Totals for A-S-O was 690.631.\\nThe Totals for S-O-N was 689.405\\nThe Totals for O-N-D was 688.042\\nThe Totals for N-D-J was 688.347\\nThe Totals for D-J-F was 690.085\\nIt wasn't until J-F-M(January-February-March)\\xa0that the Totals went back up OVER the BASELINE of 690.980 to 693.471.\\n\\n\\nAs I said...just look at the TOTALS for the THREE Numbers..and compare the TOTALS for THREE Numbers with the BASELINE Number.\\n\\n\\nAnd it will give you the MOST ACCURATE Number...because it is based on a Comparison of Current THREE Number TOTAL.\\n\\n\\nTo the THREE Number TOTAL of the BASELINE.\\n\\n\\nI think all of this will be CLEARER...when the THREE Numbers for J-A-S 2014 are revealed...and hopefully I will be vindicated.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHere are those Charts.\\n\\n\\nCHART # 1  EACH MONTH   CPI-W INDEX   TOTAL   AVERAGE     JUL(2013)   230.084           AUG(2013)   230.359   690.980   230.327     SEP(2013)   230.537           OCT(2013)   229.735           NOV(2013)   229.133           DEC(2013)   229.174           JAN(2014)   230.040           FEB(2014)   230.871           MAR(2014)   232.560           APR(2014)   233.443           MAY(2014)   234.216           JUN(2014)   234.702           JUL(2014)              AUG(2014)              SEP(2014)                            *********************************************************************************  *********************************************************************************                CHART # 2  3-MONTHS   TOTAL   AVERAGE   COLA   ROUNDED  J-A-S   690.980   230.327   Baseline   0.0%  A-S-O   690.631   230.210   -0.05079%   -0.1%  S-O-N   689.405   229.802   0.22793%   0.2%  O-N-D   688.042   229.347   0.42548%   0.4%  N-D-J   688.347   229.449   0.38119%   0.4%  D-J-F   690.085   230.028   0.12981%   0.1%  J-F-M   693.471   231.157   0.36035%   0.4%  F-M-A   696.894   232.291   0.85270%   0.9%  M-A-M   700.219   233.406   1.33680%   1.3%  A-M-J   702.361   234.120   1.64680%   1.6%  M-J-J              J-J-A              J-A-S              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSurvivir\",\n",

This is because they are NOT predicting or projecting what the COLA will be. \\xa0Rather they are showing how far the current month CPI is above or below the COLA baseline (the number we need to be above to get a COLA). \\xa0So every year the line starts in January at the baseline. \\xa00% on their chart IS the baseline number. \\xa0What they are reporting is that the August number was 1.6% above the baseline. \\xa0That is all they are telling you. \\xa0In effect, if you wanted to run a projection spreadsheet like Survivr does, you would take the number they reported for June, July and August and average them...so the 1.6% number is ONE of the three numbers you use as an input.\\n\\n\\nOn their page now they also say \"MOAA predicts the 2015 COLA to fall somewhere between 1.6 and 1.8 percent.\" which is right in line with what Survivr is saying and what my \"basic math by looking at\\xa0the chart came up with\"...\\n\\n\\nHope this makes sense and thank you for your service from a lowly 26 year Navy guy...',\n",

The purpose of the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is to ensure that the purchasing power of Social Security and SSI benefits is not eroded by inflation.\\n\\n\\nFor purposes of determining the COLA, the average CPI-W for the third calendar quarter of the last year a COLA was determined is compared to the average CPI-W for the third calendar quarter of the current year. The resulting percentage increase, if any, represents the percentage that will be used to increase Social Security benefits beginning for December of the current year. SSI benefits increase by the same percentage the following month (January). If the increase in the CPI-W is at least one-tenth of one percent (0.1 percent), there will be a COLA. However, if the CPI-W increases by less than 0.05 percent, or if the CPI-W decreases, there will not be a COLA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSurvivir',\n",

Without a vaccine, the only way herd immunity is achieved is through exposure. Any virus that is this highly contagious, you are probably looking at needing 90% directly immune. The number changes depending on how contagious the virus is and not one size fits all. The other factor is no one knows how long the antibodies will last in one's system. Most experts already think it's around 90 days. 270m infected is 90% of 300m and 2.7m dead is 1% of the 270m. Right now, hospitals are near max capacity with only a fraction of that number. \\n\\nSo, if one was to get to herd immunity slow and easy, it would take a very long time with probably multiple exposures necessary. With vaccines, we just need to get to 270m doses and measure how long those vaccinated get infected again. Then work on vaccinating again. Now vaccinate on that time frame until it is eradicated. \\n\\nSent from my SM-G960U using Tapatalk\\n\\n\",\n",

Peace\\nVery nice to hear you got the vaccine. Also, that we have some professionalism among the youth.\\nMy neighbor who is 35, EMT, Deputy Fire Chief had both shots of Moderna now and he only had slight arm soreness. \\nHe owns his own landscaping business and tree service as well as plowing. He also cuts, splits, and delivers firewood. In his free time he hikes all over Maine and snowmobiles. So, he is a very healthy 35 yr old!\\nNot to worry, I think the Moderna shot has less effects on people than the Pfizer shot from what I have been hearing. Oh, he did say he woke up feeling a bit warm but, went back to sleep. The next morning he sent me a photo on top of one mountain looking out at Mt. Washington! If that shot can't take down a pack mule like him with anything more than a sore arm, we are in good shape. No worries coming from me. Just worried how much longer before I can get one. Probably not until 2022. Hope I can get to then without catching the RONA\",\n",

My wife walked in to that doctors' clinic last thursday without an app't and back in her car heading home in 25 minutes.\\n\\nI'm so happy that vets are reporting wonderful care with their VAMC on these shots but it's bothersome that the experiences are not universal.\\nAgreed and it is also bothersome that states and counties are not doing things in a universal manner.\\xa0 To me it is anyway.\\xa0 Now I am on to researching when they will have shots for kids under 17...I have one at 20 so he will get his when he can.\\xa0 Since Ohio is still 65+, he appears to be a long ways off....two other kids that as far as I know they have not even developed one for them yet...Sad to say, they will be quite sometime from being around their grandparents still until they can get the shots.\\nFauci said yesterday that high school kids should start seeing mass vaccinations availability beginning with the fall school season, or September. He also said\\xa0 that grade school kids should start being mass vaccinated around the start of 2022. \\nThey are following the schedule/pecking\\xa0 that the science dictates. Grade school kids are last because science is telling them that there's virtually no risk to them.\\n\\nOf course it's bothersome about states and counties not being universal, but\\xa0 veterans issues and veterans health care issues are governed and administrated by the Federal gov't/DVA so it should be/must be\\xa0 more universal.........while the 50 states and 3100 + counties are in many instances, governed and administered more independently. I saw where Ohio's governor is maintaining mask protocols and not changing that.\\nYES, he is and I love it.\\xa0 I don't have to worry about business having to deal with some of the people that go in there with no masks and we all just take their word that they got shots or worse, they have not and just don't want to wear the masks.\\xa0 I have had to leave so many places when customers start to yell and scream at the workers that are implementing the state guidance as well as their employers guidance.\\n\\nThe schools in my area have teachers next week getting their second shots.\\xa0 The teachers are not required to get them and we are not told which ones have or have not.\\xa0 My kids school has had to shut down 4 different times due to so many teachers being sick and there not being enough workers and subs to have class.\\xa0 My kids have been 4 days in school for most of the year otherwise.\\xa0 They were shut down twice due to so many kids being exposed and they did not want to take a chance.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nSo my kids will be not seeing their grandparents for that long...just perfect.\\xa0 It is what it is.\",\n",

      "2-- of course they don't. That is why only hospitals that have the proper freezers should have been on the list to get the Pfizer product. The other hospitals start getting other products next week. <br/>\n",

But I have my opinion. From  General Gus on down people are creating, coordinating and delivering the next to impossible. From science, production and to the warehouse. From the warehouse to distribution by plane, train, truck and person. Training and the drilling of the medical staff, pharmacy staff and even students of both groups on delivery of the vaccine. Marketing required for us consumers from urban life to the rural ranch. Learning the obstacles and doing OJT as it goes. I find the  facilitation of the vaccine distribution extraordinary. I will ad that many of the participants in this expedited service are risking their own health, at  entry into the winter of 2020, to save lives.

According to this morning's Boston Globe these two groups total about 51 million and federal health officials estimate there should be enough vaccine to vaccinate all of them by the end of February. My 95-year old mother and (I'm not allowed to say) year-old wife qualify. I may just squeak in. I turn 75 on Feb 23. Also waiting to see what VA receives and how they arrange priorities. <br/>\n",

      "There was a story in yesterday's New York Times about how the city vaccinated  6 million residents in less than a month in 1947 after a traveler arrived in the city and infected a couple of people who died of smallpox. As amazing as that effort was, it was much easier than what we are faced with now because it was just one city. They were able to use vaccine stockpiles sent from other cities and the military. And there was no anti-vax movement at the time and lots of WWII veterans who were used to lining up for shots. <br/>\n",

      "Your doomsday you described assumes everyone who contracts covid will manifest with serious to deadly symptoms and illnesses............that is not the case thus far.</div></blockquote>The scenario I outlined is hardly a doomsday scenario. Without a vaccine, the only way herd immunity is achieved is through exposure. Any virus that is this highly contagious, you are probably looking at needing 90% directly immune. The number changes depending on how contagious the virus is and not one size fits all. The other factor is no one knows how long the antibodies will last in one's system. Most experts already think it's around 90 days. 270m infected is 90% of 300m and 2.7m dead is 1% of the 270m. Right now, hospitals are near max capacity with only a fraction of that number. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\n",
      "So, if one was to get to herd immunity slow and easy, it would take a very long time with probably multiple exposures necessary. With vaccines, we just need to get to 270m doses and measure how long those vaccinated get infected again. Then work on vaccinating again. Now vaccinate on that time frame until it is eradicated. <br/>\n",

      "I did say something wrong before. Originally, hospitals getting vaccines were supposed to split their shipments. If they got 10k doses, 5k now and 5k in 21 days for Pfizer, for example. That changed in the past month. They can give all 10k now because they will get 10k more by 21 days and those are earmarked as dose 2. There is no way of knowing if those are a problem yet because the first of those won't be shipped until around 1/1 at the earliest. <br/>\n",

That being said, the FDA and CDC have had data in their hands for a couple of weeks and acted last week like Moderna gave them a surprise when it was official. I'm not concerned yet. I will be concerned if by 2/1, vaccines aren't flowing to people smoothly and effortlessly. <br/>\n",

      "I did say something wrong before. Originally, hospitals getting vaccines were supposed to split their shipments. If they got 10k doses, 5k now and 5k in 21 days for Pfizer, for example. That changed in the past month. They can give all 10k now because they will get 10k more by 21 days and those are earmarked as dose 2. There is no way of knowing if those are a problem yet because the first of those won't be shipped until around 1/1 at the earliest. <br/>\n",

      "I did say something wrong before. Originally, hospitals getting vaccines were supposed to split their shipments. If they got 10k doses, 5k now and 5k in 21 days for Pfizer, for example. That changed in the past month. They can give all 10k now because they will get 10k more by 21 days and those are earmarked as dose 2.

    "We have been here before already on several occasions.&nbsp; Things begin to look a little rosier, then reality comes back to kick us square in the ass.&nbsp; The general populous tires of following the rules and restrictions put in place for their own good.&nbsp; We simply have to dine out. We simply have to gather with friends and family.&nbsp; We simply can't remain trapped at home.&nbsp; Logic would then follow that we will simply have to die once again in greater numbers.&nbsp; A hard but sad truth none the less.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We would all love to see things get back to some semblance of normalcy.&nbsp; &nbsp;It will be wonderful when we can once again gather together with those we love without fear.&nbsp; It will be wonderful when we can freely get out and about again.&nbsp; It would be even more wonderful if we had the gumption it takes to sacrifice what need be in order for that day to get here sooner rather than later.&nbsp; If we are not willing to make those sacrifices necessary to put an end to these cycles of reinfection we are likely dooming ourselves to history continually repeating itself and the dreaded \"new normal\" will continue to be our way of life.<br>\n",
