The cost of fighting COVID-19 has not been finalized nor has how long the cost will go on.  The virus has no time table no matter who says it will go away. \\n\\nThe unemployed numbers will improve somewhat, but winter will interfer with the  gain of jobs available. Christmas money is being spent today by those who are unemployed. It will be a long winter for many as the sickness continues and the deaths come.  This will work against the psychic of the population. \\n\\nI doubt there will be a meaningful recovery for two or three years.  No work today means millions of folks with no ability to spend income other than on basic needs. This no spending ability results in no loan applications no matter how low interest rates fall.  How do banks and lending institutions make money off no interest loans. I doubt loans will be offered to people with no income or significantly reduced incomes? I think this is similar to the great depression we  may revisit. For the sake of my children and grandchildren's future I sure hope I'm wrong.  Herd I do hope your right but I think we will be fortunate if we get a moderate improvement. Damn gg, I'm actually leaning your way. Peace\\nI fear you are correct.  The virus is the catalyst that both creates and controls this recession.  The market always corrects and has an up and down rhythm adjusting to world events.  This time, we have a virus in every country in the world.  In the US, we do not have a uniform approach to the virus and it is much worse in places, so we get a different response in every state.  The problem with that is when it invades a place thought to be safe, there is that 14 day delay, then it trends up often 3% or so per day, that 3% is on top of the previous days total, so at the end of a second cycle of 14 days, about 28 days after the infection routes are established into previously safe community, then it is suddenly a crises.  SO, they shut things down, but still have 14 days of new people already in the pipeline, plus all those infected the first 28 days, plus new people they infect.  The virus is controlling the economy at the local level and 50 different state level approaches will try to deal with it. Not saying that is bad, just reporting the fact.\\n\\nThen the effect of the virus on countries outside the US comes into play and it is pretty much the same. .  I fear the economy will be down a very long time.   Being optimistic is great, but realistic says we need to keep our heads down until there is a solution, a vaccine, a treatment, something that will slow it.  We do not have that, except for extreme isolation, masks and all that.\\n\\nHope I am wrong.  As an investor there is certainly safety in Walmart stock or perhaps some medicine.  But the travel and vacation industry is pretty much gone, the cruise lines will likely not come back for many years. Any portfolio that has travel and entertainment type holdings is certainly at risk.\\n\\nAnd if the government spends $10 trillion or whatever the current urging is inflation will happen soon.  Hope I am wrong.  \n",

The virus will die out, people will go back to work in masses soon, but this issue with oil and oil/gas prices, that one is serious and will affect the economy as much or more than the covid. \\n\\nYou are right about some industries tho, even with restaurants reopening at 50% capacity, it does not alleviate their burdens as it's estimated that 70% is needed to break even.\\n\\nThe drop of .8% in consumer prices announced Tuesday included a drop of .4% in core prices. That index, which excludes food ad energy, was the sharpest  drop  for a given month  since 1957,  An if that continues, deflation can be and probably would be even more devastating to the economy.\\n\\nA  big positive tho, the underlying economy was extremely strong before this overreaction to covid and it contains a lot of pent-up demand, people are not going to sit this out much longer because a vaccine is still an ''iffy thing'' and may or may not happen. \\n\\nBrighter days are ahead and it won't be long.  \n",

I suppose that with an operation of that magnitude it's only to be expected.\\n\\nStill, building confidence in the proper storage, timely distribution and delivery of hundreds of millions of doses of these vaccines, let alone administration, is already leaving much to be desired.\\n\\nHow can things get screwed up?  Wish that I could be more optimistic but, \"Let me count the ways.\"  \n",

Not bad for something that has never happened before. \\n2-- of course they don't. That is why only hospitals that have the proper freezers should have been on the list to get the Pfizer product. The other hospitals start getting other products next week. \\n3--Facilities that have already given the first shots were supposed to split their vaccine and keep half as the second dose. \\n4-- this is one week into the most incredible vaccine project in the history of mankind. You just want to complain. \\n\\nSent from my SM-G960U using Tapatalk\\n\\n  \n",

But I have my opinion. From  General Gus on down people are creating, coordinating and delivering the next to impossible. From science, production and to the warehouse. From the warehouse to distribution by plane, train, truck and person. Training and the drilling of the medical staff, pharmacy staff and even students of both groups on delivery of the vaccine. Marketing required for us consumers from urban life to the rural ranch. Learning the obstacles and doing OJT as it goes. I find the  facilitation of the vaccine distribution extraordinary.

Before this, the fastest any vaccine had ever been produced was 4 years. Now, one of the largest hurdles is actually dry ice. There has been a CO2 shortage since the beginning of this pandemic because people aren't producing CO2 like before. \\n\\nThis has been nothing short of amazing. There will always be ignorance and people nitpicking details even three days into it. We are living through one of those times in history which will serve as a benchmark for all mankind. Pasteurization of milk, polio vaccine, fat man and little boy, the Apollo project, and COVID-19 vaccine in way under a year to name a few. \\n\\nSent from my SM-G960U using Tapatalk\\n\\n  \n",

According to this morning's Boston Globe these two groups total about 51 million and federal health officials estimate there should be enough vaccine to vaccinate all of them by the end of February. My 95-year old mother and (I'm not allowed to say) year-old wife qualify. I may just squeak in. I turn 75 on Feb 23. Also waiting to see what VA receives and how they arrange priorities. \\n\\nThere was a story in yesterday's New York Times about how the city vaccinated  6 million residents in less than a month in 1947 after a traveler arrived in the city and infected a couple of people who died of smallpox. As amazing as that effort was, it was much easier than what we are faced with now because it was just one city. They were able to use vaccine stockpiles sent from other cities and the military. And there was no anti-vax movement at the time and lots of WWII veterans who were used to lining up for shots. \\nJim  \n",

By most experts account's, herd immunity without a vaccine for covid-19 might actually be impossible. It would require intentional infection at almost a million cases a day. Hospitals couldn't keep up and 2.7m people would die in just the US alone in 9 months before you might have to start over. \\n\\nVaccines will make herd immunity possible and with ability to add boosters when antibodies decrease, this is subtracting multiple years away from any non- vaccine attempt. How do I know this? I work down the hall from one of the most knowledgeable ID doctors on the planet and I asked him. \\n\\nSent from my SM-G960U using Tapatalk\\n\\n  \n",

So your expert source, what is his opinion of what level of the general population we need to be at to achieve herd immunity? \\n\\nEverything I've seen is between 70%--75%, does he support that. I see your sources are saying it might be impossible, but I haven't seen that being reported widespread........heck I haven't seen that reported at all.\\n\\nYour doomsday you described assumes everyone who contracts covid will manifest with serious to deadly symptoms and illnesses............that is not the case thus far.The scenario I outlined is hardly a doomsday scenario. Without a vaccine, the only way herd immunity is achieved is through exposure. Any virus that is this highly contagious, you are probably looking at needing 90% directly immune. The number changes depending on how contagious the virus is and not one size fits all. The other factor is no one knows how long the antibodies will last in one's system. Most experts already think it's around 90 days. 270m infected is 90% of 300m and 2.7m dead is 1% of the 270m. Right now, hospitals are near max capacity with only a fraction of that number. \\n\\nSo, if one was to get to herd immunity slow and easy, it would take a very long time with probably multiple exposures necessary. With vaccines, we just need to get to 270m doses and measure how long those vaccinated get infected again. Then work on vaccinating again. Now vaccinate on that time frame until it is eradicated. \\n\\nSent from my SM-G960U using Tapatalk\\n\\n  \n",

I had a friend test positive for antibodies in July who never knew she had COVID-19 but now doesn't test positive for antibodies. That was a very short time period. \\n\\nI know most hospitals around where I'm at have very few beds available whether they are ICU or med/surg units. They are converting to ICU when they can. The good news is a ventilator isn't the kiss of death it was in the beginning. While there might be long term effects, people do go home now after being on a ventilator. \\n\\nI did say something wrong before. Originally, hospitals getting vaccines were supposed to split their shipments. If they got 10k doses, 5k now and 5k in 21 days for Pfizer, for example. That changed in the past month. They can give all 10k now because they will get 10k more by 21 days and those are earmarked as dose 2. There is no way of knowing if those are a problem yet because the first of those won't be shipped until around 1/1 at the earliest. \\n\\nI do think this whole ordeal probably could have gone smoother. It is also one of the largest undertakings in the history of mankind. That being said, the FDA and CDC have had data in their hands for a couple of weeks and acted last week like Moderna gave them a surprise when it was official. I'm not concerned yet. I will be concerned if by 2/1, vaccines aren't flowing to people smoothly and effortlessly. \\n\\nSent from my SM-G960U using Tapatalk\\n\\n  \n",

We are more rural and most facilities here won't see Pfizer because of the freezer required. Most people here won't even start getting vaccinations until maybe today. \\n\\nI'm sorry you had issues with finding a facility with a bed. I can't imagine how that felt trying to find a hospital with an open bed. \\n\\nSent from my SM-G960U using Tapatalk\\n\\n  \n",

I had a headache for about 24 hours but that's it. \\nWe were told that about 7 days after the first vaccine you *Should* be about 52% protected.   About 7 days after the second injection you *Should* be 95% protected. \\n\\nWe wound up having less employees take the vaccine than originally said they were interested.  My organization was not about to waste any vaccines.  They offered to first responders and school nurses. We have <10 doses left today.\\n\\nWe are fortunate that we have a genetic research facility in our town and they do have the storage facility needed.  I was on the fence about taking the vaccine until I talked to the MD who founded the genetics center.  Oddly enough, he was my daughter's pediatrician 42 years ago.  He put my mind at ease. I probably would have taken it anyway because I want to keep my SobosPete protected until he can receive the vaccine.\\n\\nPraying the manufacturers can keep things ramped up and this will available to everyone soon.  There is hope that we will see the end of this!  \n",

Apparently its supposed to be distributed by each county and by appointment. Its already becoming crazy. Each county is doing it differently and not checking that individuals actually live in the county. Its like a rat race to get the small quantity available. Sort of like the rush to buy toilet paper when covid started.\\nI really would like to not get in the rat race. I'm 83 with several physical issues and my wife is 75. It would be nice if I could sit back and wait for the VA to call me for a shot, which the VA says they will eventually do. It also would be nice if my wife, who is not a veteran,  could get the shot from the VA also. Too much to hope for, I guess??????  \n",

Apparently its supposed to be distributed by each county and by appointment. Its already becoming crazy. Each county is doing it differently and not checking that individuals actually live in the county. Its like a rat race to get the small quantity available. Sort of like the rush to buy toilet paper when covid started.\\nI really would like to not get in the rat race. I'm 83 with several physical issues and my wife is 75. It would be nice if I could sit back and wait for the VA to call me for a shot, which the VA says they will eventually do. It also would be nice if my wife, who is not a veteran,  could get the shot from the VA also. Too much to hope for, I guess??????\\nI got a feeling here in my area that I can probably get a covid vax shot  at a local doc faster than I can at the VA........and I am supposed to be high-=risk category.  \n",

I dont imagine it would include the opportunity to include my wife. I just would like to avoid the frenzie of getting in the lines at a convention center to get a shot. I think that the VA would have a more disciplined process than what I am already seeing in my community. Just wondering?  \n",

Just wondering?\\nHappy New Year Steve!\\n\\nI don't think the VA is providing that service to dependents.\\n\\nFrom the VA:\\nUnder this plan, we’re now offering vaccines to these 2 groups:\\n\\nVeterans living in our long-term care facilities, and\\nVA health care personnel. Vaccinating our VA health care personnel helps us continue providing care for Veterans.\\nAfter these first 2 groups, we’ll begin to offer vaccines to more Veterans who are at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19.\\n\\nRon  \n",

I dont imagine it would include the opportunity to include my wife. I just would like to avoid the frenzie of getting in the lines at a convention center to get a shot. I think that the VA would have a more disciplined process than what I am already seeing in my community. Just wondering?\\nPretty sure your wife, non-veteran spouse, can get that covid vax shot in the private sector faster than you will get yours at the VA. \\n\\nPlease don't take this wrong and no disrespect intended, but I shudder at the thought of the VA providing spousal healthcare when a lot of  VAMC's cannot even handle the present Veterans workload on a timely basis.  \n",

You may not want the vaccine. But I assure you direct medical care staff, like my kids, are very glad to receive the vaccine.

To really present a safe and tested True Vaccine, it would take the better part of a decade. ALL OTHER vaccines have been tested this way for well over 50 years.\\nIt's not an accident, that we use such safeguards, it's very important.\\n\\nAlso a true vaccine would not just reduce common symptoms, it would offer a real defense against actually getting sick.  This is missing with the current approach.\\n\\nIf that same symptom reduction can be achieved by alternative methods than injecting a truly untested \"vaccine\" with potential side effects, then we owe it to ourselves to explore that option, and not present to ourselves an unnecessary risk.\\n\\nNot all medical staff are \"glad to receive the vaccine\" , my ex-wife who is a retired Air Force nurse, has specifically said, the evidence is lacking, and to call it safe at this point is a huge play in misinformation.\\nMany in the medical community are not comfortable with this vaccination, but are being pressure from the highest level to carry the flag, and not speak out.  \n",

Covid is behaving in much the same way so it is reasonable to expect that this will not be  \"once and done\". The Covid vaccine will likely, when used over a much larger group, not hold to 95% efficacy.  That doesn't mean that 70% won't help us get back to normal or allow someone to be ill with much milder symptoms.  \\n\\nI work with great Prescribers (a term we use for MD /PA/ ARNP/ CRNA). They were the first to step up to receive the vaccine.  Although I am no longer a bedside RN, I have been somewhat involved with COVID (working our drive through testing clinic, administering vaccines, etc).  I have found that most of the folks who are questioning whether to receive the vaccine have not been directly involved with the care of Covid patients.  The ones who have been in the trenches are, by and large, rolling up their sleeves. \\n\\nAs to your PCP \"I asked, can I reduce the symptoms if I catch the virus without receiving the shot?\\nHe said yes, most certainly you can.\"  He should have said more of the line of \"Maybe you can, maybe you can't but no one will know until you catch it.  There are treatments that help some, but not all people.  It is a crap shoot.\".\\n\\nI am not going to criticize anyone for not taking the vaccine.  It is a personal decision. For me, I feel like taking the vaccine gave me an extra roll in that crap shoot.  Second one coming up on Friday.  \n",

I am not sure whether I will get the vaccine or not... we have some decisions to make regarding that...\\n\\nMrs B is quite skeptical and as of the current Climate, she is thinking she doesn’t want to get the vaccine right away... she is also not wanting our soon to be 17 year old daughter to get the vaccine either for the time being... \\n\\nI am not on the list of high priority targets for the vaccine but right now that is a moving target ... more lung scans to come it appears!\\n\\nWe have sort of a quandary... I’m more than ambivalent about the shot, I worry about our high risk granddaughter... she has heart issues, she has pulmonary issues... I have been getting  the flu shot for years, (required) has it helped? No idea but I can’t remember ever having the flu....\\n\\nI never got any of the shit I was inoculated for in my military travels... couldn’t even begin to lay out the shots and inoculations... going somewhere even briefly? Here are a shit ton of required shots... no problem... any of those shots less than perfect? No idea, I never asked and would likely have just been kicked in the ass and given the shot anyway!\\n\\nI’m not sure either way right now and it’s looking like we will have a little while before we are even offered the shot...  \n",

Did anyone else receive anything.\\n\\nVeterans, please call 334-260-4144 to leave a message with your first name, last name, last four and phone number. Our schedulers will contact you to schedule an appointment to receive the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.\\n \\nVaccinations are scheduled based on the Veterans risks associated with contracting COVID-19. If a Veteran falls into a higher risk group, they will be scheduled immediately. Veterans who are not high risk will be scheduled later when more Moderna COVID-19 vaccines arrive. Please call ASAP to let us know you would like to receive the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. \\n \\nWife and I will be contacting them to see where we stand...will keep everyone posted on how soon or later.\\n\\nSent from my SM-G970U using Tapatalk\\n\\n  \n",

I am glad for that because our numbers of hospitalized patients are higher than they were in the spring. \\nThank you, I am in Bamberg, the Lowcountry so it's kinda a news desert, since we are in the Augusta, GA viewing tv jurisdiction.

I have listened to them and evaluated their recommendations and am still alive and doing reasonably well.  My doctors recommend that at my age and with my conditions that I take the shot. I am waiting until my doctor (Baptist Hospital) has the vaccine for over 65 (this week or next). I won't get it elsewhere, Many of my friends have received the vaccine basically in drive thru settings. Not for me. I want it in a medical setting. Just me  \n",

Mass Medical Center. He said a lot of the staff there haven't had shots yet, including him, though he isn't dealing directly with COVID patients. He said because I'll be 75 in late February that may get me vaccinated by March or so, but he has no idea about vaccine supply and availability. I said I'm also waiting to hear from V.A. He said maybe I'd get it sooner there, but no one knows.\\nJim  \n",

They're working today too Sunday. Lots and lots of nurses on overtime. My VA gives out the Pfizer vaccine. \\nThe other vaccine is Moderna.  Both are highly effective but Moderna has 3 times the vaccine. Gotta hurt more getting that.  \n",

In the civilian world the states have been given a lot of latitude in how they distribute the vaccine. This has led to the situation that we see. We found out yesterday that there is a phone number that my wife can call tomorrow to get scheduled for the vaccine.  I have already said that I will get my first shot tomorrow. I don't know why there is such a difference in the VA facilities. \\n\\nSent from my SM-G960U using Tapatalk\\n\\n  \n",

I am getting my vaccine though the VA. I  expect that it will take some time to get through the phone number. That is through the health district. \\n\\nSent from my SM-G960U using Tapatalk\\n\\n  \n",

I tried to contact my county health department and could never get through until I learned all the vaccine was gone, call back in a week. So, I sent a simple email to the state health department, no complaint, just simply said, we are 72 and 69, I have asthma, she has diabetes and just want to get in line.    I got a very nice email from a government official, a nurse, who said she would reserve 2 slots for me the next day, 3 counties away, and above my priority group.   My wife is scared of the vaccine as she had a major reaction to the flu shot so only I took the first shot.  At least I should not give it to her.\\n\\nThe process was highly orchestrated, like any military operation.  The event was in a mall, the parking lot traffic and entrance was  handled by national guard members who kept you in your car until your group came up then moved you through a processing line.  Everyone masked up and keeping distance.  I was in line one minute, stopped a second minute for processing, put in  chair for one minute, and then taken to a large room where people were sat about 12-15 feet from all others.  Nurses and National Guard Medics patrolled the room watching for adverse reactions. They put a piece of tape on you showing either the time 15 or 30 minutes later when you could leave depending if you had reasons to worry about an allergic reactions. An ambulance was sitting at the door and many , medics available should  something go south.\\n\\nSo, my comment is the VA has not notified me of anything on the vaccinations and I should be fairly high on the list.  The state stepped right in.  Just one case may not mean anything.  But if they could  follow the example I saw it would not be a big deal.  Best of luck to each of you.  I have learned so much from this site and the many straight up guys and gals on here. Keep safe.  \n",

I played 3 ends against the middle. I have been in contact with  Safeway pharmacy, and Walgreens they both indicated no go. My next door neighbor received her injection from safe way pharmacy.\\n\\nI did not blame any of them for the situation that exists.\\n\\nIt appears to me that the distribution of the vaccine is haphazard  and that communications with the end users of the vaccine is not happening as it should.\\nSurely somewhere there is a documented plan on who, where, and when.\\n\\nFor those of you who have medicare it may be advisable to check with every source for this vaccine and determine who are able to provide it .\\n\\nI have a feeling the VA as a system knows not the when each medical center will receive a shipment.\\n\\nThe logistics of this operation indicates that their plan for distribution has been shit canned which is pretty normal.  \n",

Lindstrom Clinic in Colorado Springs should be able to do so soon, once shipments of the Moderna vaccine arrive, hopefully before the end of the month, he said. The Moderna's vaccine doesn’t need to be stored in such extreme cold, and will allow for more flexibility with distribution.\\n \\n“The team, we’re in planning stages right now, so that when the vaccine does get here, we’ll be able to roll that out,” Kilmer said. “We are working on a plan, when we have enough supplies to get them close to you.\"\\n \\nBut, \"I do not know when we will have those vaccines on site (in Colorado Springs).”\\n \\nRobocalls began going out to enrolled and eligible veterans Thursday morning, letting them know they’re among the high-risk group prioritized to receive the vaccination and offering to connect them with a scheduler that can set up an appointment.\\n \\nThe night before, around 5,000 veterans joined a virtual town hall during which Kilmer and his VA colleagues addressed the vaccine rollout. Veterans came armed with questions, about the vaccine’s safety and efficacy, how and where it’s administered and what makes a person a “priority” candidate.\\n \\nThe agency has around 11,000 members over 75, a high-risk population that should, along with front-line clinic staff, be among the first to be vaccinated, according to guidelines from the CDC and the Veterans Health Administration, said pharmacist and vaccination program lead Terrence Wong.\\n \\n\"We understand that everybody wants to be vaccinated,\" said Wong, adding that his team was working as quickly as possible to meet demand and expand access to older veterans living outside the Denver metro area, in rural communities and those who are home-bound.\\n \\nAfter a \"monumental effort\" over the last few weeks — inoculating the Aurora site's clinical staff with the Pfizer vaccine, which is administered in two doses spaced 21 days apart — Wong said everyone is now prepared to deliver it to others who need it the most.\\n \\nEligible veterans who want to get the vaccine from the VA first need to pick up the phone.\\n \\n\"Please don’t come into the medical center and ask for the vaccine. We will reach out to you,\" Wong said. \"If you are one of those veterans who are over 75, please expect to hear from us in the near future.\"\\n \\nAnd if you don't, call them: 1-888-336-8262, and chose option 2.\\n \\nFor those who don't fall among the current VA priority group, vaccine access is coming. But given the limited supply, Wong said younger veterans could be facing a wait of \"months, possibly years.\"  \n",

My sister is 66 and has medical issues.  She got on the Oklahoma web site and found a rural place that had 3 vials left, so she and her husband drove 120 miles and going back later and happy to do so.  There are over 800  or more people that have died within 45-50 miles of her house so it is a pretty serious deal.  When you live in a small state like Oklahoma and you just look at how many have died close to where you live it starts looking pretty serious.  So, driving 120 miles each way is suddenly well worth the drive.  \\nDo not know if I posted this but we had 1 family member die and 11 total got it when they went to Rapid City and Deadwood the week before Sturgis, contract tracers showed the got it there.  They did not wear masks or take precautions and there were none in place there.  Joe was 61 and had no medical issues, healthy,  did hard physical work and no one thought he was at risk.  \\nThen  I have a doctor outside the VA and he got it and died of it on Nov 18th, after pushing me to take precautions and get the vaccine as soon as it came out.  He was 68, a Viet Nam combat vet and darn good guy.   Since then I have had 2 more guys that I know who died of it, one was 72 and heavy, the other 66 and a jock, he was a high school coach.\\n\\nSo, we take it pretty seriously around here.  I am surrounded by people in my community who still think it is no big deal and there are no mask requirements or any restrictions in Oklahoma so the rate of spread is close to the highest in the nation.\\n\\nKeep safe.  \n",

I drove the 40 miles there and total time to check in, shot and 15 minute wait to check for reaction and  out the door was appx 30 mins.  I have to say I was very, very impressed how efficient they were in processing the large number of people there to get the vaccine.  I have an appointment on Feb 12 for the second vaccine, I got the Moderna vaccine.  \n",

I have no idea when I will get mine and can't get a human to tell me even as much as what priority group they have me in (I know which one I should be in tho but can't get them to confirm it.).\\n\\nMeanwhile, my county thru the state is moving along at a fast pace getting people vaccinated. I know a number of people, mostly non-veterans,  my age already got their first shot and scheduled for their 2 shot.  \n",

According to some locals, several have already received their vaccinations. Being in a high-risk category, but not quite 75 yet, I was curious as to why I haven't received any news pertinent to Arizona's VA Vaccine Program. I decided to DM my VA Primary Care Doc, and here's the response I received minutes ago: (Cut & Pasted from DM on HealtheVet).\\n\\n\"Age is 75 at VA for Covid vaccine (Federal)\\n\\nYou can contact the Arizona department of health there age is 65 (State)\\n\\nInfo for Veterans wanting the vaccine\\nVeteran immunizations are scheduled to start Monday, Jan. 4. Veterans will receive either a call or text telling them they are eligible based on their priority group. The message will alert them to call the call center to schedule their vaccine. Veterans who call the call center to schedule a vaccine BEFORE they receive the text/call will not be able to schedule an appointment. However, all Veterans can sign up with the “Keep Me Informed” tool at https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/. Please share this information if/when a Veteran asks you for information.\\n\\nWe are in the process of reaching out to eligible Veterans based on prioritization by VA Central Office (these priority groups were not established locally). Prioritized Veterans will get a phone call or text message as they meet criteria asking them to call the call center to schedule an appointment. These calls will contain a reference code that is non-transferrable, which will they use to identify themselves as part of that particular priority group.\\n\\nThere is no need for Veterans to preregister, call or come in to sign up -- enrolled Veterans will receive a call/text when they are eligible to receive the vaccine. Additionally, if Veterans call and do not have the reference code, they will not be able to make an appointment.\"\\n\\nI've been on the \"Keep Me Informed\" email list for well over a month. I don't know how it's going in other regions, but suffice it to say that things here in AZ, IMO, are totally... you know what... 'd up -- this includes the AZ Dept. of Health. They ran out of available vaccine in two days after lowering the age to 65. Wifey and I will not be able to try and register for vaccination with AZ State Dept of Health until February sometime, and possibly get shots sometime in March.\\n\\nWhat's everyone else's experience with Covid, either at the State level or with the VA?  \n",

I called this morning and now I have my first shot lined up for tomorrow and the second one scheduled for Feb 18. They couldn't find me in their system when I called because I go to Jamaica Plain, but I was handed off to someone who worked some magic and then switched me back to the vaccine scheduler, and just like that I had an appointment. I wish the state system worked this well. My wife and I have been trying all day to get appointments for her and for my 96 year old mother through the state's dysfunctional system.\\nJim  \n",

There was a steady stream of people coming and going but no actual line. I got there a few minutes before my noon appointment and had my shot right at noon. Two guys ahead of me had 1:30 appointments and told the clerk they would go the cafeteria and come back, but she said no and sent them right in. \\n\\nI can't thank you enough for the heads-up about Bedford because I've still had no official word from the VA other than they will call and let me know when they have a slot for me. \\n\\nMeanwhile my wife posted on the local town Facebook page about my good luck at Bedford and I've now added some more information for people who didn't know this was an option. \\n\\nAs for my wife, after trying and failing all day yesterday to get her a slot anywhere, when I got back this afternoon I logged onto the states vaccine web site and saw they had added a new large red dot in Springfield, that wasn't there in the morning. They had just opened registration for a new site and we were able to get an appointment for my wife's first shot on Feb 5. But we will still try again late tonight or early, early tomorrow morning to see if we can get her in sooner at Gillette Stadium -- where they are only schedule appointments one day at a time. What a system!\\nJim  \n",

They are really interested in me due to my age (75) to see what the effects of vaccine has on older people--I am really concerned about the Va taking away my I/U status due to receiving this money from the test program--plese give me your advice--I don't want to lose my I/u status--thanks in advance for your advice---  \n",

My curiosity is if they may prioritize me. \\nI am 44 and I know some of my factors are my own fault. I have a BMI of 31 as per the online calculators, of course anyone that ever has seen me would never think I am overweight. I am a smoker. Though, the other factors A+ blood type and Male. Both of which, we know now are factors. Though, they haven't made them priorities in the factorization of who gets it first.\\nWhile you all seem to be out west. I am in Maine. \\nI have signed up for the waiting list in my state and also on the VA website so, hopefully one of those two will vaccinate me sooner than later.\\nI also, had signed up for a few vaccine trials. I just don't live in the right location to participate. \\n\\nFor those who have seen media about Ivermectin. I sure hope it is as much of a golden egg as they are making it. Not any of that hydroxychloroquine conspiracy nonsense. \\n\\n\\nBest of luck for all of you wanting to be vaccinated. I deeply hope you all get vaccine asap. The more of us to get it the sooner this BS will be over. Don't listen to those nay saying politicians and doctors who say life won't ever be normal again. Take a look back at previous pandemics. Were we still a twisted society walking around with masks after those events... NO. So we will be ok once we get a hold of this scourge.  \n",

Considering there are many layers to the spectrum and autism is seen in vaccinated and those who haven't been vaccinated. Even with a higher prevalence in those who have been vaccinated doesn't directly make a correlation between the two. Genetics have a greater effect on the chances of autism than vaccinations.  \n",

The VA long term care patients got both of their shots and the VA health personnel got both of their shots and now it's time for the over 65 folks to be next, which includes me.

The VA long term care patients got both of their shots and the VA health personnel got both of their shots and now it's time for the over 65 folks to be next, which includes me. I have gotten two emails about the vaccine and have been told on both of them that I will be notified when it is my turn. I tried to get my wife lined up for the vaccine locally and every time I go the link, it says no appointments available. Go figure!!\\nThey're doing 75 and over first, then 70, then 65.

I am wondering because I thought the Moderna was 28 days later but I've seen 30 days in some convo's  and I just happened to notice that my 2d shot is scheduled for day 29.\\nI found this:\\n\\nWhat’s the recommended dosage?\\nSAGE recommends the use of the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine at a schedule of two doses (100 µg, 0.5 ml each) 28 days apart. If necessary, the interval between the doses may be extended to 42 days.\\nCompliance with the full schedule is recommended and the same product should be used for both doses.\\n\\n----> LINK\\n\\nRon  \n",

It had to be the most organized and well planned event I've been to in a long time. Easy parking as all 5 levels of the Garage #1 were open, and gates up. I don't think prior to my shot, I was at any check in station more than 30 seconds.

It had to be the most organized and well planned event I've been to in a long time. Easy parking as all 5 levels of the Garage #1 were open, and gates up. I don't think prior to my shot, I was at any check in station more than 30 seconds. The shot was quick and painless, the nurse very friendly, and I spent 15 minutes in the waiting area before leaving making sure there was no side effects. \\n\\nTheir goal is to vaccinate 3000 of us senior veterans 65 and over this weekend.

Expected a long wait. But the set up was well done and very efficient. We had the paper work done and was given the shot within ten minutes. Then a 15 wait. Never left the truck. \\n\\nWe often talk concerns about the younger generation. I would guess the average age of the folks that directed us through the process and gave the shots was around 25 years. They were attentive and polite. This was the county health department's work.  Our rural NorCal county has a population of 29,000. A well done job. We return on 3/6/21 for the 2nd shot. Peace\\nVery nice to hear you got the vaccine. Also, that we have some professionalism among the youth.\\nMy neighbor who is 35, EMT, Deputy Fire Chief had both shots of Moderna now and he only had slight arm soreness. \\nHe owns his own landscaping business and tree service as well as plowing. He also cuts, splits, and delivers firewood. In his free time he hikes all over Maine and snowmobiles. So, he is a very healthy 35 yr old!\\nNot to worry, I think the Moderna shot has less effects on people than the Pfizer shot from what I have been hearing. Oh, he did say he woke up feeling a bit warm but, went back to sleep. The next morning he sent me a photo on top of one mountain looking out at Mt. Washington! If that shot can't take down a pack mule like him with anything more than a sore arm, we are in good shape. No worries coming from me. Just worried how much longer before I can get one. Probably not until 2022. Hope I can get to then without catching the RONA  \n",

Was too depressed to do anything. Meditated through pain with denial, until yesterday when Wifey showed me this...\\n\\nMade me laugh...\\n\\nHopefully we’ll be able to get to the car tomorrow so Wifey can drive me to VA Clinic Vaccine Drive-through. Wifey got her Moderna shot Saturday, I’m sked for Pfizer tomorrow afternoon!\\n\\nTry to keep warm and stay safe everyone. \\n  \n",

Just this past friday morning, I got a news update from my VAMC bragging that they  as of that moment, 2/12/2021,  had administered 6,200 shots. \\nMonday, they held a big ''first come, first served'' walk-in at the USC Coliseum. They didn't even bother to contact older vets with comorbidity who had appointments one to two weeks out to see if maybe we wanted to try the walk-in. \\n\\nI would still not be vaccinated on my first shot had I waited on them.\\n\\nHappy for so many other vets and honestly not at all surprised about Dorn on this thing.\\n\\nMy county, one of the smallest in the state and the 2d poorest, has already administered more shots than that. I have a number of non-veteran friends who got their 2d shot last week.  \n",

Didn't the VA start the vaccinations back in late December? We49 days into the new year and they have now administered a million shots..........about 20,000 a day on average across the largest healthcare system in the country, maybe the world. \\n\\nI dunno, is that good enough for bragging rights. I would rather know what percentages of their patient load have they vaccinated.  \n",

Waiting to see if I have any SEs.\\nJim\\nI had mild headache and mild nausea most of the day after, but am back to normal this morning. Not nearly as bad as the Shingrix vaccine that had both me and my wife feeling moderately crappy for a few days.  \n",

The nurse asked if I was allergic to anything. I said yes, I'm allergic to nuts. I hate the taste. She said she was going to watch me for 15 minutes. I said that's a long time. Can we go somewhere more private? The doc came over and jerked me up, pointed to the door, and said ok \"private\" march! They did not like me, let me tell ya.  \n",

I had previously completed both my shots at the  Dublin VAMC. We both received the Maderna vaccine with little or no negative effects. Certainly glad that we have the best protection available at this time. I hope that all of you get the vaccine as soon as it is available for you.

The place is called \"last chance grade\" which has been under construction since the hwy was built. My place is 20 miles south of Crescent City. Today the usual hour scenic round trip drive takes minimum of four hours. \\n\\nOur medical, grocery and other needs are on the otherside of the slide. We have been going south to Arcata for groceries.  My wife missed her 2nd vaccine shot as we couldn't get through that day. I and our 97 year old aunt are to get our 2nd shots this Saturday. They say the wait may be down to an hour each way. Tons of rock are being hauled 24/7. Literally hundreds of dump loads will be taken off the mountain. Discussions of busting a new hwy through the back county have been going on for as long as I can remember. The guys working at the slide site are probably the grandchildren of guys who worked the same location when I was a kid. It's a mess. Peace  \n",

We simply have to gather with friends and family.  We simply can't remain trapped at home.  Logic would then follow that we will simply have to die once again in greater numbers.  A hard but sad truth none the less.\\n\\nWe would all love to see things get back to some semblance of normalcy.   It will be wonderful when we can once again gather together with those we love without fear.  It will be wonderful when we can freely get out and about again.  It would be even more wonderful if we had the gumption it takes to sacrifice what need be in order for that day to get here sooner rather than later.  If we are not willing to make those sacrifices necessary to put an end to these cycles of reinfection we are likely dooming ourselves to history continually repeating itself and the dreaded \"new normal\" will continue to be our way of life.\\n\\nIt will take every one of us doing our part, no matter how insignificant we may think it is, to get this monster finally under control and put behind us.   Lord willing, we will succeed.\\n\\n   \n",

My understanding is the vaccine will likely keep you from death due to covid and maybe out of a hospital stay. But you can still get sick. As you know some of us can't afford to get sick.

My understanding is the vaccine will likely keep you from death due to covid and maybe out of a hospital stay. But you can still get sick. As you know some of us can't afford to get sick. Also there are lingering negative physical effects that can be detrimental to health. So I will be practicing stay safe measures likely for 6-12 months more minimum. I would add these stay safe practices have kept me from the usual nasty sick flu bugs for the first time in years. PeaceI only read the Moderna research, but all the research candidates who were vaccinated and subsequently tested positive, weren't symptomatic. Get shot, don't die. Maybe grow third arm. \\n\\nSent from my SM-G960U using Tapatalk\\n\\n  \n",

My understanding is the vaccine will likely keep you from death due to covid and maybe out of a hospital stay. But you can still get sick. As you know some of us can't afford to get sick. Also there are lingering negative physical effects that can be detrimental to health. So I will be practicing stay safe measures likely for 6-12 months more minimum. I would add these stay safe practices have kept me from the usual nasty sick flu bugs for the first time in years.

She is scheduled for her second shot in about 10 days.  \\nShe is lining up my wife to come down and help her with kids in case she gets sick from the second vaccine. SIL going out of town for a week and there have been a bunch of teachers getting quite sick for 3 to 4 days after then second shot. Moderna vaccine. 3 to 4 days of bad migraine type headaches, fever, chills, nausea, etc.\\n\\nIt was explained to her that it appears those with very strong immune systems, the younger folks, tend to have a tougher time with the vaccine, especially the Moderna second shot. It appears the healthier and more robust your immune system operates, the harder it fights allowing the vaccine to take hold in the body...\\n\\nI’m no doctor but it kinda makes sense...  \n",

My arm is sore even though I barely felt the vaccine shot. Just another day of taking it easy. Hope it is a minor thing as we are going to the valley 120 miles tomorrow. Getting a heart monitor and another nuclear heart test through VHA Community Care referral. Grandma also has a study scheduled for pancreas issue which hopefully is not a serious problem. We will stay two nights and hit a guitar store and Costco. Peace  \n",

My understanding is the vaccine will likely keep you from death due to covid and maybe out of a hospital stay. But you can still get sick. As you know some of us can't afford to get sick. Also there are lingering negative physical effects that can be detrimental to health. So I will be practicing stay safe measures likely for 6-12 months more minimum. I would add these stay safe practices have kept me from the usual nasty sick flu bugs for the first time in years. Peace\\nMoto, I too am one of those that can't afford to get sick, given my compromised lungs and prior respiratory failures............. but, I also cannot  stop living so I won't get sick and die. \\n\\nMany states are lifting mask mandates but, that's not saying that you personally must or should  do differently if your personal choice is to continue wearing one. \\n\\nThe vaccine's purpose , besides stopping you from getting sick or dying, is to accelerate  the attainment of ''herd immunity' among the general population,,,,,,,,,,,,and in that regard, it's working and will get us there pretty soon. And BTW, science supports that.\\n\\nLike you and many others, I was practicing disciplined sanitary habits a long time before covid and will continue to do so. I have also taken my RDA of Vitamins and key nutrients in the form of a daily vitamin for years............and I added more D3/Zinc in the past months. That's as critical as washing your hands and probably more critical than wearing a cheap blue paper mask in most areas. \\n\\nWe will have to see about the variants, if they're covid/sars variants, we should be ok. Pretty sure from what I've read that we can expect an annual booster for some time to come, no problem for me, I get the flue shot anyways. \\n\\nBesides the wonderful news of cases and deaths dropping and the administering of the vaccine kicking in to high gear, there's also great news out there on 2020-2021 flue cases, esp in children.............apparently we've only had one child death from the flu this season compared to 188 last season. \\n\\nThis too, is passing.\\n\\nPS--and now it looks like a Covid treatment pill, a 5 day regimen and similar in nature to the Tamiflu treatment has now been developed.  \n",

For example, we've had masks ordinances in our town and county since  June but not a single ticket has been issued since the ordinance was placed in force. \\n\\nI know people who have caught covid and who were avid mask wearers and at least one of them died. I am far greater bothered by the sizable number of people who refuse (or refusing) to get the vaccine than I am by the non-mask wearer. If you keep your safe distance, the threat is greatly reduced, almost eliminated.\\n\\nI am hoping that as more people get the vax, that those naysayers will in part come around.  \n",

I am at the highest risk level due to severe lung damage (100%) and have numerous  other factors.  While the state put me at the top of the list the VA had nothing to say until after the state had opened up the vaccine to almost everyone.  I have several pending medical issues and am in the building every few days and no one has said a word about it.   They do not even ask about the flu shot at each visit like they did in the past.  Just seems like the quality of care has down dramatically the last few months.  I am guessing the covid has worn them down and they are just letting things slip.  When you enter the building now the just ask if you are sick and take your temperature, nothing more then you are free to roam the building.\\n\\nHere in Oklahoma people never wore masks much and today I went to a local grocery store and saw only one person wearing a mask among dozens, me.  I have had the vaccine but do not see any value in blowing off the mask just yet.  The last flu year on record, 2019 had only 85 people die of the flu. We had 89 die one day last week and 80 another day.  So far there  are about 7,500 dead in the year since the first covid case in our state.   The running 7 day average is 32 dead per day.  And they predict a big surge coming the next few weeks and then it will last a couple months after that.  As an example 6 months ago the average daily death rate was about 10 per day, by December it was 23 and now 32 dying per day so for people who understand math it is by far the worst point it has been.\\n\\nSo, the vaccine is really needed as folks are not wearing masks in public, the grocery store does not have the hand cleaner near the carts like they had before.   So, we need to at least push the vets to get the shot and pay attention a little bit longer.  FWIW  \n",

       "3823                       yeah ek he looked at my treatment records in service and also va and other records  i was smart and followed advice from vbn and got my cfile  put that and all xrays on a thumb drive  went to the new doc with thumb drive and we spent almost two hours covering everything  im really glad i found this guy  now we have to find out if there is anything bad from the asbestos  i would think the board has what it needs now to sc the lungs  i dont have an axe to grind the doc who put the chest tube in saved my life  there was an accidental injury  its amazing how much stuff that tube has to go through  im just praying that there is nothing from the asbestos and that the board grants my appeal  thanks for checking in   \n",

       "3827  let me just cover the process  file initial claim denied  file nod denied file form  substantive appeal  after the nod the lawyer could request a hearing with the dro decision review officer  you only get so much time after a denial  statements from people are only used at the appeal stage  when you filed originally was that a fully developed claim  look pro bono is nice and im glad to see that happen but you have to protect your claim by learning what the steps are  it almost seems like you may have to start over  intent to file is not even a claim or a fully developed claim  think of it as a placeholder once you gather up your evidence and submit it then you have a claim   has department_of_va ever scheduled you for a cp exam   \n",

I submitted my claim in 2014, and sometime in 2015 I was denied. I appealed right away, and was denied in 2017.

said they should do something about it if i cant get through well they were no help just told me they would have to forward my call  it may be whining but its been  years and they dropped the ball if
